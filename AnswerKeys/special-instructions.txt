For 06th April Shift 1st (Morning), in the provisional final answer key the correct answer to one of the integer questions is marked to be "3483638676" which is very odd.
It seems to be a mistake from NTA while making final provisional answer key.
But since there's no confirmation for the same, the analyzer considers this value to be the correct answer.

For 08th April Shift 1st (Morning), Question ID "3666943020" is "DROP" for Hindi Medium but is valid for other mediums with "11" as correct answer.
Default answer marked in answer key is 11 since Response Page doesn't include medium of paper, there's no way of knowing what medium the sheet uploaded belongs to.
